<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>This project is being undertaken as part of a research study conducted by Professor Peter Bruza and Ms Lauren Fell of QUT.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The purpose of this project is to understand how people view and think about images.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You are invited to participate in this project because you are a current user of Mechanical Turk.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Participation</strong></p>

<p>Participation will involve looking at a set of 4&nbsp;images. Each of these image pairs will have 3&nbsp;questions attached to them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This will take approximately 5 minutes of your time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Questions will ask about the left and the right images, and will ask simple questions such as what your first thought was when you saw them. You will also be asked to rate your confidence in your decision, as well as the reasons you had to make your decision.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your participation in this project is entirely voluntary. If you agree to participate you do not have to complete any question(s) you are uncomfortable answering. Your decision to participate or not participate will in no way impact upon your current or future relationship with this requester on Prolific. If you do agree to participate you can withdraw from the project during your participation without comment or penalty. However, as the survey is anonymous once it has been submitted it will not be possible to withdraw.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Expected benefits</strong></p>

<p>It is expected that this project will not directly benefit you. However, it may benefit researchers working to understand more about how people perceive and trust images on the web.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>To recognise your contribution should you choose to participate the research team is offering you </em>the indicated sum of money belonging to the task you selected.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Risks</strong></p>

<p>There are no risks beyond normal day-to-day living associated with your participation in this project.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>PRIVACY AND Confidentiality</strong></p>

<p>All comments and responses are anonymous and will be treated confidentially unless required by law. &nbsp;The names of individual persons are not required in any of the responses.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Any data collected as part of this project will be stored securely as per QUT&rsquo;s Management of research data policy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The project is funded by Interpares Trust and they not have access to the data obtained during the project.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Consent to Participate</strong></p>

<p>Submitting the completed online survey is accepted as an indication of your consent to participate in this project.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
